      <h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Broadcast is a role-playing game in which you will direct, produce and star in your own television series. Each player will create a character that is the star of their own story-line. You will explore a major story arc for your character each season with each season lasting for a single session.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="time">Time</h2>
<p>Time isn’t exactly linear in this game. On the same day one player may<br>
shoot a scene for episode 2 while another player is shooting episode<br>
16, It’s fine. There is only one fixed point in time for this game and<br>
that lies somewhere between your piles. Everything to the left is<br>
before that point and everything to the right is after that point. How<br>
much before or after is up to you. Try to think of of it like this,<br>
your left pile are are scenes that have already been shot but still<br>
need to go to post. Your right pile is still being written, this is a<br>
draft of the script and it will go that way if your character gets its<br>
way but, things are subject to changes. In this game post isn’t done<br>
on a computer its done through conversation. If something doesn’t make<br>
sense try to talk out how you can use the footage you have to make it<br>
work. If that can’t be done, do a re-shoot. Play out a pivotal scene<br>
again or make a new one to see how it turns out.</p>
