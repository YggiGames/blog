<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Broadcast is a role-playing game in which you will direct, produce and star in your own television series. Each player will create a character that is the star of their own story-line. You will explore a major story arc for your character each season with each season lasting for a single session.</p>
<h1 id="game-rules">Game Rules</h1>
<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="what-youll-need">What you’ll Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>A bunch of note cards. (just bring the whole pack)</li>
<li>Some other human beings. A few or more but, less than lots.</li>
<li>Writing utensils. Enough to share.</li>
<li>A handful of 6-sided dice</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pitch your show</strong> Follow the rules to create a pitch.</li>
<li><strong>Assemble your Crew</strong> Create crew cards for the following roles: Producer, Director, Writer. Just write the roles on some blank cards. Grab extra blank cards for each player above  three. Shuffle all the cards and deal them out.</li>
<li><strong>Start Production</strong> You are ready to begin filming. Follow the filming directions until everyone has had a chance to try out all the roles a few times.</li>
<li><strong>Mid-Season break</strong> Take a 5 minute break. Then, shuffle the role cards as in step 2. discuss plot twist? highlight new actions</li>
<li><strong>Resume Production</strong> repeat step 3</li>
<li><strong>Plot Twist</strong> do the plot twist</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="filming">Filming</h3>
<ol>
<li><em>(director)</em> <strong>previously…</strong> Your left card left the viewers wanting more. Remind them why they are excited to see this scene.</li>
<li><em>(producer)</em> <strong>focus</strong> The producer chooses a theme for this scene.</li>
<li><em>(writer)</em>  <strong>snag</strong> The director chooses a snag from the focus in step 2. hand this card to the writer</li>
<li><em>(director)</em>  <strong>choose</strong> Place the snag in front of you (not in a pile). Choose one:
<ul>
<li>Choose a pile</li>
<li>Choose an action. write it on a new card.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>(producer)</em> <strong>choose</strong> The producer then performs the option not chosen in step 4</li>
<li><em>(writer)</em> <strong>engagement roll</strong> Make an roll for the character with the chosen action. If the action roll is a failure the <em>writer</em> should turn the current action card sideways.</li>
<li><em>(director)</em> <strong>action</strong> Play out the scene. Cast the other players to play the other roles in your scene. You overcome the snag in this scene; however, if the roll in step 6 was a failure there is a major cost or consequence.
<ul>
<li>If the left pile was chosen:
<ol>
<li>play the scene overcoming the current snag with the action.</li>
<li>place the action on top of the left pile (keep orientation)</li>
<li>place the snag on top of the left pile</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the right pile was chosen:
<ol>
<li>play the scene overcoming the snag on the right pile with the current action.</li>
<li>place the action on top of the right pile (keep orientation)</li>
<li>place the snag on top of the right pile</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>(director)</em> <strong>next time…</strong>  A quick glimpse into the future foreshadowed by your top right card. One or two sentences.</li>
<li><em>(all)</em> <strong>pass</strong> Everyone with a role card passes it one player to the right.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="playing-a-scene">Playing a Scene</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>establish the stakes</strong></li>
<li><strong>set the scene</strong> Choose one.
<ul>
<li><strong>slug-line</strong> Write down a place and time. These can be exact or relative details</li>
<li><strong>establishing shot</strong> Describe what we see to set the context before the scene unfolds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>set the roles</strong> Figure out all the roles for your scene. You may discuss intents or circumstances with the other players. Each player ultimately has authority over their own character.</li>
<li><strong>assemble your actors</strong> Assign each role to a Player. Players may have more than one role. Players should always play their own character.</li>
<li><strong>action</strong> find out what happens.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you need a character that doesn’t already belong to player, you have two options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>make one</strong> Grab an index card write down a name and a quick description. Set that card down in the middle for everyone to see. Something like <em>Doris, The elderly bank-teller</em> works fine.</li>
<li><strong>take one</strong> Take a character from those previously made. Need an innocent bystander during your convenience store robbery? Just put <em>Doris, The elderly bank-teller</em> in harms way.</li>
</ul>
<p>This game takes some liberties with the linearity of time. As such, finalities such as death can lead to some awkward situations. Here are some ways to avoid the confusion which might be cause by reconciling disparate stories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>don’t</strong> Let things not make sense. Shows have plot holes all the time. It’s okay!</li>
<li><strong>the cliff hanger</strong> Literally and figuratively, use a cliffhanger. Don’t chop off someones head when you can kick them over the edge of a cliff and walk away.</li>
<li><strong>a wizard did it</strong> Crazy things happen in the real world. Crazier things happen in an imaginary world. Perhaps some fundamental assumption you made about the world is just wrong. Maybe death isn’t so final or maybe you aren’t as good at killing as you thought.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>Pitch</p>
<ul>
<li>more guidance on creating a pitch. Not a list of options to choose from ask really open ended questions.</li>
<li>Something like, “You are about to cut loose, where are you? how did you get there? who is that over there?” I dont want to be leading but I want people to think about the minutiae. Instead of asking what time period this is and getting an answer like “the future” I want to ask how did they get to work and get a response like “The vactube”. That instantly tells everyone else way more.</li>
<li>maybe I can ask simple questions</li>
