## Jargon
I will collect domain specific, ambiguous or vague terms here as this series progresses.

graph
: A structure that contains related objects. For our purpose the objects contained are vertices or sub-graphs.

sub-graph
: A graph contained in another graph.

vertex
 : An object contained in a graph

edge
 : A relationship between two vertices

relationship
 : A set of edges connecting two vertices. The order of a relationship is the minimum number of edges required to connect the vertices

journey
 : A player created graph. Represents an agent's path through the context

agent
 : An object in the shared imagination space which players may directly control. Also a vertex in the context.
 
context
: The state of the the shared imagination space. The graph which contains all other graphs.

layer
: A labeled sub-graph of the context. All vertices in a layer share the label as an implicit relationship.
 
Obstacle 
 : A vertex used to split a single unresolved edge into two unresolved edges.
