# Welcome

This is the home of Yggi Games. Here you will find the results of me playing, poking and hacking games.

My current projects are:

* **Rules Supplements** --- Self contained rules which currently build upon 5e by bringing ideas from other sources.
* **Project Graph** --- A series investigating applications of mathematics in understanding story-telling games.
* **Greenlight** --- A story-telling game used as a reference implementation of my findings from **Project Graph**.
