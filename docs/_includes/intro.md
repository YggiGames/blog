# Welcome
This is the home of Yggi Games. Here you will find the results of tinkering with, hacking and creating various games. Some of what you find here may even be tested. Enjoy!

My current projects are:
* **Project Graph** --- A series investigating applications of mathematics in understanding story-telling games.

* **Greenlight** --- A story-telling game used a reference implementation of my findings from Project Graph.

* **Rules Supplements** --- A series of self contained rules which currently build upon 5e by bringing inspiration from other games.
