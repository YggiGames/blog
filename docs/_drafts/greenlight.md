<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Greenlight is a role-playing game in which you will direct, produce, write and star in your own television series. Each player will create a character that is the star of their own story-line. Together, you will explore the story of an entire television season in a single session.</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="what-youll-need">What you’ll Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>A bunch of note cards. (just bring the whole pack)</li>
<li>Some other human beings. A few or more but, less than lots.</li>
<li>Writing utensils. Enough to share.</li>
<li>A handful of d6.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="action-roll">Action Roll</h3>
<p>When a player character faces a challenging situation, you may be asked to make an action roll to resolve the outcome. Unlike some games, your character always does the thing it set out to do; however, the cost is still uncertain.</p>
<p>When making an action roll, the player rolls the number of d6 indicated and chooses any die as the result. If the result is 4-6, it’s a success. If the result is 1-3, it’s a failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro Tip: No dice? coins work too! Heads is success, tails is failure.</p>

<h2 id="guidance">Guidance</h2>
<h3 id="when-you-have-a-plan">When you have a plan</h3>
<p>Be honest about your plans with the other characters. It can be very tempting to try to setup a twist on your own. Resist that urge, let the other players in on your plans enough that they can help you get there.</p>
<h3 id="when-things-go-sideways">When things go sideways</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may be required to turn a card sideways. I use landscape as the normal orientation and, portrait as sideways. It doesn’t matter just pick one and be consistent in your group.</p>
<h3 id="when-that-thing-happens-that-changes-everything">When that thing happens that changes everything</h3>
<p>At some point in the story a thing happens, it changes everything! Or maybe it doesn’t… Or maybe its ripples are felt in subtle ways which we are not meant to understand. Sometimes the thing is the same thing for all the characters and sometimes the thing is a different thing.</p>
<p>The point is, there is a thing which we don’t name and we don’t talk about that separates the story into two parts. The parts that happen before it from the parts that happen after it.  We call the before part of our story <em>The Before</em> and we represent it with a pile of cards in front of us and to the left. Likewise, We call the after part of our story <em>The After</em> and we represent it with a pile of cards in front of us and to the right.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-take-five">When you take five</h3>
<p>You are going to work on <em>The Pilot</em> and you are going to create an awesome setup for a melodrama about a group of time-traveling android archaeologists in some kind of love dodecahedron. Then, the rules are going to tell you to <em>take 5</em> and you are going to want to ignore it. DON’T! The breaks are there for a reason. They will give your group time to use the bathroom or grab snacks without interrupting the flow of the game later on. They also gives you some time to turn things over in your own brain or lets you talk about things with another player outside the rules of the game.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-cant-agree">When you can’t agree</h3>
<p>Flip a coin, go with it.</p>
<h3 id="when-things-dont-make-any-sense">When things don’t make any sense</h3>
<p>This game takes some liberties with the linearity of time. As such, finalities such as death can lead to some awkward situations. Here are some ways to avoid the confusion which might be caused by reconciling disparate stories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>don’t</strong> — Let things not make sense. Shows have plot holes all the time. It’s okay!</li>
<li><strong>cliff hanger</strong> — Literally and figuratively, use a cliffhanger. Don’t chop off someones head when you can kick them over the edge of a cliff and walk away.</li>
<li><strong>a wizard did it</strong> — Crazy things happen in the real world. Crazier things happen in an imaginary world. Perhaps some fundamental assumption you made about the world is just wrong. Maybe death isn’t so final or maybe you aren’t as good at killing as you thought.</li>
