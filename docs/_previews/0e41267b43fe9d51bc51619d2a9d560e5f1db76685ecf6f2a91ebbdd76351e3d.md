# Choosing our domains (not the cleric kind)

This article is kind of a detour. I wanted to establish new terminology and introduce a few methods for working on problems later on.

I'm just going to get this out of the way. We are about to get into some math here; namely, lambda calculus. It sounds scary and if you are looking ahead it probably looks scary too but, it's actually very simple. There are really only three steps to all of our problems here.

1. Assignment --- Draw an arrow, put the stuff you know on the left and the thing you want to know on the right. 
   * $(input_1, input_2, ..., input_n) \mapsto output$
2. Abstraction --- Convert a single function with many inputs to many chained functions with single inputs. 
   * $input_1 \mapsto (input_2 \mapsto ( ...  (input_n \mapsto output) ... ))$
3. Application --- Evaluate the function chain.
	* $f_1: input_1 \mapsto f_2 ;...;f_n: input_n \mapsto output$

## The Talking Domain

**Assignment**

* inputs
	* $S$, established *shared imagination space*
	* $N$, talking to each other using *natural language*
 
* output
	* $S'$, resulting *shared imagination space*

$(S, N) \mapsto S'$

**Abstraction**

apply currying,
$(S, N) \mapsto S' \implies S \mapsto  (N \mapsto S')$

decompose and rewrite,
$f: S \rightarrow g \implies f(S) = g$
$g: N \rightarrow S' \implies g(N) = S'$

**Application**

$f$ takes a *shared imagination space* and prompts a response
$g$ takes the *natural language* of that response and changes the *shared imagination space*

>$f$ could be a GM establishing a scene and asking, "What do you do?"
>$g$ could be a player describing their actions.

## The Graph Domain

**Assignment**

* inputs
	* $S$, established *context*
	* $N$, talking to each other using *natural language*
 
* output
	* $S'$, resulting *context*

$(C, M) \mapsto C'$

**Abstraction**

apply currying,
$(C, M) \mapsto C' \implies C \mapsto (M \mapsto C')$

decompose and rewrite,
$f: C \rightarrow g \implies f(C) = g$
$g: M \rightarrow C' \implies g(M) = C'$

**Application**

$f$ takes a *context* and prompts a *move*
$g$ applies a *move* to create a new *context*

>$f$ could be an enumeration of *context* options
>$g$ could be a player engaging the *context* with a *move*.

## Changing Domains

### *shared imagination space* $\mapsto$ *context*

**Assignment**

* inputs
	* $S$, established *shared imagination space*

* output
	* $C$, derived *Context*

$S \mapsto C$

**Abstraction**

simply rewrite,
$f$:  $S \mapsto C \implies f(S) = C$

**Application**

$f$ takes a *shared imagination space* and produces a *Context* 

> A *Shared Imagination Space* and a *Context* are two sides of the same coin. The *Shared Imagination Space* is what exists as collective knowledge in the minds of the players. The *context* is the interface to that space.

### *context* $\mapsto$ *shared imagination space*

**Assignment**

* inputs
	* $C$, derived *Context*

* output
	* $S$, established *shared imagination space*

$C \mapsto S$

**Abstraction**

simply rewrite,
$f$:  $C \mapsto S \implies f(C) = S$

**Application**

$f$ takes a *context* and produces a *shared imagination space*

## Why does this matter?



$(S, C') \mapsto S'$
$S \mapsto (C' \mapsto S')$
$S \mapsto (C' \mapsto (S,N) \mapsto S')$
$S \mapsto (C' \mapsto (S \mapsto (N \mapsto S')))$
