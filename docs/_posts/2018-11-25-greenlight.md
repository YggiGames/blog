# About

GreenLight is a role-playing game in which you will direct, produce, write and star in your own television series. Each player will create a character that is the star of their own story-line. You will explore a major story arc for your character each season with each season lasting for a single session.

# Game Rules

## The Basics
### What you'll Need
* A bunch of note cards. (just bring the whole pack) 
* Some other human beings. A few or more but, less than lots.
* Writing utensils. Enough to share.
* A handful of d6

### Action Rolls
When a player character faces a challenging situation, you may be asked to make an action roll to resolve the outcome. Unlike some games, your character always does the thing it set out to do; however, the cost is still uncertain.

The player rolls a number of d6 as indicated and may choose any die as the result of the roll. If the result is 4-6, it's a success. If the result is 1-3, it's a failure.

### The Character

1. Grab a blank card as *The Character*, name it and place on your left. This is the begging of a pile know as *The Before*.
2. Give *The Character* a short description.
3. Grab a blank card as *The Agenda*, write a goal on it and place upside-down and sideways on your right. This is the begging of a pile known as *The After*.

### The Hype

Ask *The Player* what action they are most interested in seeing *The Character* use. Record on 'The Character' as 'The Hype'

### The Crew

Create crew cards for the following roles: Producer, Director, Writer. Just write the roles on some blank cards. Grab extra blank cards for each player above  three. Shuffle all the cards and deal them out. 

### The Trailer

Create the trailer. Imagine you must create a 15 second trailer for the show. 

Take turns, writing down things that are in the trailer or things that got cut from the trailer.

Things in the trailer are what you definitely want to be a part of your game. Things cut from the trailer are things you definitely don't want in the game. 

When it is your turn to write one of these down, you have the final say, Say yes to ideas you are exited to explore. Say no to ideas that are over used or obnoxious.

After the first round, go around again. If everyone had something to add, keep going around. 



## The Shoot

1. *(director)* **Previously...** — If *The Before* has not been recapped, give a short description of what happened.
2. *(producer)* **The Focus** — Choose a focus as *The Focus*.
3. *(writer)*  **The Snag** — Choose a snag card from *The Focus* as *The Snag* must be different that *The Before* and *The After*. Give *The Snag* to *The Director*.
4. *(director)* **The Scene** — Place *The Snag* on *The Before* or next to *The After*. The card on top of the selected pile is now *The Scene*.
5. *(director)* **The Action / The Plan** — Choose one:
 		* After *The Plan* and *The Detail* are chosen, choose an action as *The Action*. Record on *The Scene*.
		* Choose a plan as *The Plan*. The *writer* will always choose the *Detail*. Record on *The Scene*.
6. *(producer)* **The Plan / The Action** — The producer then performs the option not chosen in step 5
7. *(writer)* **The Detail** — choose the *Detail* for *The Plan*. Record on *The Scene*.
8. *(director)* **The Position** — Make an *action roll (1d6)*. If *The Action* is one of your highlighted actions, You may establish how the action helps or hinders your chances to instead make an *action roll (2d6)*.
	* ***success*** — *The Position* is *Risky* when *The Scene* starts
	* ***failure*** — *The Position* is *Desperate* when *The Scene* starts. Turn *The Scene* sideways.
9. *(director)* **The Scene** — Play out *The Scene*. 
10. *(director)* **Next Time...** — If *The Snag* was placed next to *The After* place it on top of *The After* and give a quick preview of what might happen.
11. *(all)* **pass** — Everyone with a role card passes it one player to the right. 

### The Scene 

1. **The Price** — If *The Position* is *Risky*, what are you about to lose? If *The Position* is *Desperate*, what did you just lose?
2. **The Slug** — Provide a general location and/or time. Record on *The Scene*.
3. **The Shot** — Describe what we see in the moments before the scene unfolds.
4. **The Cast** — Assign each role in *The Scene* to a Player. Players may have more than one role. Players should always play their own character. Each player ultimately has authority over their own character's actions. 
5. **The Action** — find out what happens.

### The cast

If you need a character that doesn't already belong to player, you have two options.
* **make one** — Grab an index card write down a name and a quick description. Set that card down in the middle for everyone to see. Something like *Doris, The elderly bank-teller* works fine.
* **take one** — Take a character from those previously made. Need an innocent bystander during your convenience store robbery? Just put *Doris, The elderly bank-teller* in harms way.

## The Break

1. *(all)* **Take Five** — take a five minute break.
2. *(all)* **The Crew** — Do *The Crew* if you haven't; otherwise, just shuffle roles.
3. *(each)* **The Hype** — Do *The Hype* with 'The Player' on your right.

## Guidance

### When things go sideways.
Sometimes you may be required to turn a card sideways. I use landscape as the normal orientation and, portrait as sideways. It doesn't matter just pick one and be consistent in your group.

### When that thing happens that changes everything
At some point in the story a thing happens, it changes everything! Or maybe it doesn't... Or maybe its ripples are felt in subtle ways which we are not meant to understand. Sometimes the thing is the same thing for all the characters and sometimes the thing is a different thing.

The point is, there is a thing which we don't name and we don't talk about that separates the story into two parts. The parts that happen before it from the parts that happen after it.  We call the before part of our story *The Before* and we represent it with a pile of cards in front of us and to the left. Likewise, We call the after part of our story *The After* and we represent it with a pile of cards in front of us and to the right.

### When you *take five*
You are going to work on *The Pilot* and you are going to create an awesome setup for a melodrama about a group of time-traveling android archaeologists in some kind of love dodecahedron. Then, the rules are going to tell you to *take 5* and you are going to want to ignore it. DON'T! Or do, I'm not your mom. The breaks are there for a reason. They will give your group time to use the bathroom or grab snacks without interrupting the flow of the game later on. They also gives you some time to turn things over in your own brain or lets you talk about things with another player outside the rules of the game.

### When you can't agree
roll a die, go with it.

### When things don't make any sense
This game takes some liberties with the linearity of time. As such, finalities such as death can lead to some awkward situations. Here are some ways to avoid the confusion which might be caused by reconciling disparate stories.
* **don't** — Let things not make sense. Shows have plot holes all the time. It's okay!
* **cliff hanger** — Literally and figuratively, use a cliffhanger. Don't chop off someones head when you can kick them over the edge of a cliff and walk away.
* **a wizard did it** — Crazy things happen in the real world. Crazier things happen in an imaginary world. Perhaps some fundamental assumption you made about the world is just wrong. Maybe death isn't so final or maybe you aren't as good at killing as you thought.

## Author Notes


crew
* crew advances to change how the game is played or allows the rules to be modded?

Actions
* differnet actions set the scope of the game. make some new sets or have guidlines

Pitch
* more guidance on creating a pitch. Not a list of options to choose from ask really open ended questions.
*  Something like, "You are about to cut loose, where are you? how did you get there? who is that over there?" I dont want to be leading but I want people to think about the minutiae. Instead of asking what time period this is and getting an answer like "the future" I want to ask how did they get to work and get a response like "The vactube". That instantly tells everyone else way more.
* maybe I can ask simple questions if I say certain answers aren't allowed
* lookup microscope setup as pitch
