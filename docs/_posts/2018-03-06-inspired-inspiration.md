# Inspired Inspiration: Better Character Engagement by Cutting Facets

## A Case for Cutting Facets

**Issues**
* Gaining inspiration is unpredictable for players.
* Players are scared to spend inspiration because they might need it later.
* Giving inspiration puts a heavy burden on the DM to remember everything on each character's sheet.
* DMs lack guidance on the frequency and basic conditions to grant inspiration

**Goals**
* Give player's rules to predictably earn inspiration.
* Allow players to spend inspiration confidently.
* Remove the burden on the DM in remembering to hand out inspiration.
* Reward players for engaging with the story.
* Reward players for engaging with these mechanics.
* Provide additional hooks for DMs to create character focused stories.
* Don't break the game, use the existing rules. Provide clarification not contradiction.
* Don't break the characters, a character in this game can play in another game or come back without issue.
* Don't break the party, Allow players to use these rules without interfering with other players not using them.


## When to Use These Rules

If you often forget to give out inspiration.

If you have given up on inspiration.

If you want give your players a mechanical reason to become more involved in the story.

## Inspired Inspiration

### Gaining Facets

> **Rule**
> 
> When your character undergoes a **significant change**, your character may gain a new **facet**.

**Significant Change**

A significant change may be either a mechanical or narrative change with a substantial impact on your character. 

Mechanical changes may include:
* gaining a class feature
* learning a new feat 
* gaining a racial feature

> When you want to write something on your character sheet, there is a
> good chance it is a mechanical change. It's significance is up to you.

Narrative changes may include:
* receiving the boon of a god
* stealing the bounty of a dragon's horde
* earning the ire of a scorned lover

> When you want to write something in notebook, there is a good chance
> it is or will lead to a narrative change. It's significance is up to
> you.

Don't forget about new characters. A character becoming a level one adventurer is surely a significant change for them.

**Facet**

A facet is simply a word or short phrase which represents the fictional experience of your character.

> **Choosing a Facet** 
> 
> When you gain a facet, the player and DM may create a new facet that
> is appropriate to the character, the setting, and the significant
> change. 
> 
> Try to keep your facets distinct from each other. If two facets seem
> similar, Think about what makes them unique and highlight that
> difference.



### Using Facets

> **Rule**
> 
> When a player would make an attack roll, ability check or saving throw, they may choose to **invoke facet**. After the roll, the character gains inspiration.

**Invoke Facet**

Describe how one of the character’s facets manifests in the situation. The DM will offer a **complication**. If the player agrees, the facet is invoked. Each facet may only be invoked in this way once per session.

> **Choosing a Complication**
> 
> The most basic complication is to give the triggering roll
> disadvantage. This is only applicable is the roll doesn’t already have
> disadvantage. Otherwise, You may offer a cost to the roll. Costs are
> always paid regardless of the outcome of a roll.


### Advanced Facets

**Facets for everything**

Anything can have facets, not just player characters. Non-player characters, groups of characters, even environments can all have facets if you want. 

Perhaps, you imagine elves in your setting are quick-tempered. Give elves the quick-tempered facet. Alternatively, ask a player who has created or otherwise thought about elves for their thoughts. When you or a player create a new elf character give them the quick-tempered facet. Of course, not all elves are quick-tempered. If you want an elf that is level-headed, read the section Ignoring Facets.

This principle applies to other things as well. For example, you might give facets to groups such as cities, factions, monastic orders, etc. When a character is created with a strong association to a group give that character the facets of that group.

**Other uses for facets**

Facets say a lot about your character. If you have earned a facet, try to get the most out of it. Ask for advantage if you think a facet would give you one. If you once swore an oath to the drowned god and earned the facet drowned in the depths, you may know the ways of the priests at this coastal temple. Go ahead and ask you DM for advantage when you ask how long that ritual to summon the Kraken will take.

**Ignoring facets**

Some facets just aren't true for a character. Perhaps your character turned their back on the light of Pelor after seeing true darkness in the world or maybe they never understood the dwarven the lust for gold and instead lusted for knowledge of the unknown. Go ahead and ignore facets that you don't think are true about your character. Better yet, actively fight against a facet you truly despise.

**Just say no**

Sometimes ignoring a facet isn’t the right solution. Players may say no to their character’s facets at any time. Just remove the facet from the character.

**At higher levels**

A first level character will probably start off with two to five facets. Each level of play should grant one to three facets. You can even use narrative facets to simulate adventures a character may have gone on. A fifth level character might have twelve facets. If that character had earlier dealt with attacks of a frenzied owlbear, they may have the facet Moonclaw's bane to represent that story.

## Rundown

### Gaining Facets

(Lenna is joining an ongoing game with her friend Josh as the DM. She was told to create a new character starting at level one. She shows up a few minutes ahead of time to sort out her facets before the game.)

**Lenna:** I’m done with Finellen. She’s a dwarf cleric of the light. Can we make her some facets?

**Josh:** Of course!

**Josh:** First off, we decided dwarves start with the down to earth facet.

**Lenna:** Is that a short joke?

**Josh:** A little bit. Dwarves tend to be very pragmatic and level headed in this game.

**Lenna:** That doesn’t sound like Finellen at all. She’s kind of a hot head and always wants to be the center of attention.

**Josh:** That’s fine she still gets the facet. Even if Finellen isn’t down to earth, it will be a fairly common assumption made about her. You can play against the facet, ignore it, or just get rid of it.

**Lenna:** She’s a bit of rebel. I’ll keep it for now and surprise people with how different she really is.

**Josh:** What class features do you start off with? We can make up some facets for those too.

**Lenna:** I have spellcasting and my divine domain. My domain gives me a bonus cantrip that  lets me cast light and I get warding flare.

**Josh:** For spell casting, it should probably be related to your god. What god do you worship?

**Lenna:** I'm not sure. Let me look it up in the appendix.

**Lenna:** I’ll go with Sune. She’s a goddess of light and beauty. I think Finellen is kind of vain and into herself so that works.

**Josh:** Let’s go with Sune’s effulgence for spellcasting.

**Josh:** Why does Sune think you need to have the light cantrip so bad?

**Lenna:** I imagine we are going to be in some pretty dark place at some point and it would be a shame for one of her followers to fall off a ledge just because they couldn’t see. I think it should be something like a light in the darkness.

**Josh:** Yeah, I’m into that. What else did we have?

**Lenna:** Warding flare.

**Josh:** And what does that do?

**Lenna:** When something attacks me I can get really bright and give them disadvantage on an attack roll.

**Josh:** It’s like a spotlight on you?

**Lenna:** Except, I’m too bright for them to see me.

**Josh:** You said you were kind of vain. What if we play up the spotlight thing? As if fighting is almost a performance for you.

**Lenna:** Yeah, let’s go with center of attention  or  in the spotlight. Something along those lines

**Josh:** Either is fine. Choose whichever one you like the most.

### Using Facets

(Consider Steve of The Edgewood, the elf ranger. Steve is known as quite the performer even when it may not be appropriate. Steve has the facet show off. As Steve’s party journeys through the woods, they eventually find themselves squaring off against an orc patrol.)

**DM:** In front of you, a battle-scarred orc has just crawled out from the dense vegetation. It’s inky eyes meet yours. It’s posture pregnant with murderous intent. You act first, what do you do?

**Steve:** I’m in the woods, there is a tree nearby right?

**DM:** Right.

**Steve:** I’m gonna climb up the tree and let loose a couple arrows.

**DM:** Okay, I’ll need an athletics check to get up the tree, it’s been raining.

**Steve:** Actually, I want to impress Finellen. I’m invoking my show off facet.

**DM:** Sure, how are you showing off?

**Steve:** Instead of climbing the tree normally, I want to run up the side and flip onto a branch. Also, I wink.

**DM:** Okay, I have a good cost. When you flip onto the branch your arrows fall out of your quiver. When you reach into your quiver next time you find only two arrows remain.

**Steve:** More than enough for this orc.

**DM:** roll athletics, its a 10 DC to get up to the branch.

**Steve:** Okay, I’m good. I shoot the orc now.

**DM:** As you land on the branch you look down with a clear view of the orc. You have a clean shot. You also have a clear view over the vegetation and can see a hulking Ogre trailing a few paces behind.

**Steve:** At least I have inspiration.

## Sample Characters

In earlier examples, we looked at play examples including two characters, Steve and Finellen. This is what those characters might look like after running the campaign for a while. Steve's player has noted the associated change for every facet while Finellen's player (Lenna) has only recorded the list of facets. Either approach is acceptable.

**Steve, 6th level Elf Ranger**
| Change | Facet |
|:----|:----|
| Background (Entertainer)  | *show-off* |
| Race (Elf)  | *suspicious* |
| Favored Enemy (Fey) | *fey-marked* |

| Primeval Awareness | *sand speaker* |
| Ability Score Improvement (Wisdom +2)| *insatiable curiosity* |
| Spell (Silence)| *cacophony of sand* |
| Story | *curse of Al'akir* |

**Finellen, Cleric ~~of Sune~~ (2nd) rhymes with s'morelock (2nd)**
* *~~down to earth~~*
* *~~Sune's Effulgence~~*
* *center of attention*
* *a light in the darkness*
* *let no insult go unpunished*
* *burn notice*
* *the dwarf formerly known as Sune's Effulgence*
* *Al'akir's brand*
* *fire consumes*
* *eye's as embers*

>Some players may find it helpful to write their character's facets on index cards. For each facet, write the facet name on one side of the index card. As a session progresses, flip over each facet card when it is used.
