# Fox Harbor

Fox Harbor is a roleplaying game in which your group will create your own television series. Each player will develop a character that is the star of their own story-line. Together, you will explore the interconnected stories of an entire television season in a single session.

## The Basics

**What you'll Need**

* Some other human beings. A few or more but, less than lots. (3-5 for people who like numbers)
* Two types of tokens totaling three times the number of players split approximately evenly between the types.

**How to Behave**

* Be respectful.
* Be curious.
* Ask questions of the fiction.
* Find answers in the fiction.

## Setup

Begin by reading the following aloud.

>Fox Harbor is an idyllic town nestled in the protected waters of its namesake. The people are hard-working, they carry on the traditions of their past. The waters are bountiful, they provide everything that residents might need.
>
>The town is on an island, the only point on the map. The town is large enough that most residents don't know each other by name but, small enough to note an unfamiliar face. The island is large enough that none have seen it's entirety but, small enough that someone has seen everything.
>
>But, something is wrong... the traditions of the past are not as wholesome as some wish to remember and, more than fish comes out from the waters.

### Opening

> The prompts in this section are meant to help your group come up with a meaningful description of what the viewers see. Don't just answer the question, provide the full description of that part of the scene.

The show opens with a shot of open water bathed in the diffuse light of an overcast sky. 

As we see the water for the first time what does it look like? *turquoise, choppy, inky, turbid, greasy*

We hear a boat approaching from offscreen, what sound does it make? *splash, rumble, flap, whir*

As the boat passes by, we are able to appraise the crew, what state are they in? *rowdy, defeated, absent, entranced*

The crew is unbothered by something coming with in the approaching mist, what sign of something unusual is in the mist? *bellow, shadow, glint*

Why isn't the ship's crew turning around? *desire, curiosity, hubris*

Before we see what lies within. Te ship and crew are engulfed as mist fills the screen. A discordant note is stuck as the the words "Fox Harbor" fade-in. Then, cut to black.

### Vocabulary

The stories told in this game are the result of systematically combining sets of words into prompts for scenes. These words are meant to evoke certain feelings and encourage certain types of stories to emerge. Hold onto your preconceptions and understandings of these things loosely.

Read each list of words aloud. Players should ask questions about and discuss what things might mean. Try to have a vague idea what everything could mean but, save the actual answers for the **Spotlight**. 

Each player needs to choose an unchosen  **Character**. This is the character they will have authority over for the game.

> I recommend making note cards for the items on these lists. It can be quite helpful to be able to pass these around and take notes.

**Characters** 
Struggling Entrepreneur, Visiting Couple, Industrious Captain, Uninitiated Newcomer, Disinterested Muscle, The Mists, Mist-touched Youngster, Faithless Rector, Corrupt Autocrat, Fanatical Devotee, Silent Hermit, Deranged Boss, Disgruntled Warden, Capricious Animal, Stranded Reporter

**Locations** 
Indeterminately Embarked, Lost in the Mists, Secluded Altar, Legitimate Cover, Abandoned Camp, Market Alley, Forgotten Quay, Guarded Cache, Vacated Boatyard, Trendy Hotspot, Enthralling Landmark, Half-finished Sanctuary, Unreliable Ferry, Precarious Route, Mainland Past

**Scenarios**
Making a bargain, Breaking a promise, Struggling with authority, Seeing the truth, Crossing the line, Preparing a sacrifice, Taking the credit, Passing judgement, Forging an alliance, Dispatching an enemy

**Approaches**  
Jibe, Tack

Assign your tokens to Jibe or Tack. Having more Tack tokens results in more desperate characters.

**Actions** 
Obscure, Panic, Threaten, Incite, Carouse, Snoop

### History

Each player takes a turn to choose a **Character** or **Location** not already chosen. Discuss with the next player how you are all connected.

## Playing the Game

Each player takes turns in the **Spotlight**. When every player has had a turn, that is one round. A full game is typically 4 rounds for groups of 3 or, 3 rounds for groups of 4 or 5. When all rounds are complete, your group will move on the the **Wrapping Up** phase of the game. 

### Spotlight
It's time to set a scene for your **Character**. Choose a **Scenario** now or an **Approach** after. The rest of the group  chooses the other option. Whichever group picks the option should follow the directions for that type. 

> When you get a **Scenario**, you can decide where it goes in relation to other events. An  **Approach** may only be chosen if there are tokens remaining for it.

**Scenario**
	Where is the character? (Choose a **Location**)
	What other characters are here? (Choose at least one **Character**)

**Approach**
	If **Tack**, What's pushing you back? 
	If **Jibe**,  What's pushing you forward?

Choose an **Action**.

The scene takes place into the middle of or in the immediate fallout of your action. Describe the **Scenario** as viewer of the series would see it at home. Recruit the other players to take on the roles of any other characters involved in the scene. When everything is setup, jump into the action and play out the scene. Your agenda during the scene is to find out what happens in the constructed **Scenario** and to introduce a **Consequence** based on your chosen **Action**. When you fulfill your agenda, Another player can give you a token matching your **Approach**. 

| Action | Consequence |
|--|--|
| Obscure | Something else notices of you |   
| Panic | Something inside breaks |
| Threaten | Something valuable breaks |
| Incite | Something else is stirred up |
| Carouse | Something slips out |
| Snoop | Something is left behind |

> Giving a token is a signal that the other players are satisfied that the spotlighted player has fulfilled their agenda. The spotlighted player should take receiving a token as a cue that they can finish up the scene. If the spotlighted play hasn't gotten a token perhaps their is some disagreement over the agenda. Players should push the scene towards fulfilling the agenda through their own characterization and failing that, by asking questions

### Wrapping Up

The player with the most Tack tokens gets to narrate the end of the season.

The player with the most Jibe tokens gets to narrate the trailer for the next season.

In cases of a ties, tied players may accept tokens from other players for assured concessions to their narration. Negotiations continue until no other players are willing to give away their tokens and there is no longer a tie.
